# CS:APP Data Lab
Course Project for Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (CS:APP)

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation of the CS:APP Data Lab, an assignment focused on bitwise operations and integer/floating-point manipulations. The goal is to modify `bits.c` while adhering to strict coding rules and passing all test cases using the provided autograder. This assignment was submitted on September 24, 2024 through GitHub-Classroom.

## Files
- `bits.c` – Main file to modify and submit
- `bits.h` – Header file for function prototypes
- `btest.c` – Testing framework for correctness
- `Makefile` – Build system to compile btest, fshow, and ishow
- `dlc` – Static analyzer to check coding rule compliance
- `driver.pl` – Script for automatic grading
- `ishow.c`, `fshow.c` – Helper utilities for integer and floating-point representation

## Technologies Used
- C programming language
- Vim text editor
- Unix-based development environment
