# CS:APP Data Lab
Course project for Computer System Fundamentals based on Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (CS:APP).

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation of the CS:APP Data Lab, an assignment focused on bitwise operations and integer/floating-point manipulations. The goal is to modify `bits.c` while adhering to strict coding rules and passing all test cases using the provided autograder.  
This assignment was submitted on September 24, 2024 through GitHub-Classroom.

## Project Structure
- **`bits.c`** – File to modify and submit.
- **`btest.c`** – Test framework to validate solutions.
- **`dlc`** – Custom compiler to check coding rule compliance.
- **`Makefile`** – Build system to compile btest, fshow, and ishow.
- **`driver.pl`** – Script for automatic grading.
- **`fshow.c` / `ishow.c`** – Helper programs to analyze floating-point and integer representations.
- **`README.md`** – This file.
- **Other files** – Headers and test cases.

## Technologies Used
- C programming language
- Vim text editor
- Unix-based development environment
